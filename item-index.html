                            <p>My prius died while I was in four lanes of traffic, total engine shut down.  Pretty terrifying..  I looked up Radi's on Yelp, it was close to where I was, gave them a call, pulled in and within 10 minutes they told me what was wrong with my car.

                            They did a tremendous amount of research to see if the part I needed was under warranty and it looked like it was.  They sent me to the Toyota Dealership to save me the cost of paying them.  Mechanic's just don't really do that anymore. 

                            They handled my situation so well, they really went out of their way to make sure I was handled quickly and was always informed on what my car issues were.  The dealership themselves didn't handle my car as well as Radi's.</p>

                            <p>Radi's is the best mechanic shop I've ever been to. They take care of their customers very well. They have no problem explaining things for folks who don't know much about cars. They are very honest and consistent. All of their staff are very knowledgeable and they are on top of their admin. Most mechanic shops don't accept American Express, which I happen to use; they do and it makes the difference for me. Last time I was in, the work they did caused my radio to have an error. That error requires a number code to be entered to clear it and make it work again. I had to call the person who sold me the car. I bought it used from a used car lot. That lot was not helpful nor did they have the information. Aileen of Radi's made a call, found the info, and voila...it was fixed. This is one example of many, of them going above and beyond for their customers. I recommend this to everyone.</p>

                            Don't get sucked in by the lady who acts "like your aunt and is there to help you get the best, cheapest service" 

                            She's a wool puller and will take your money, more money than you should be paying, and the fellas doing the work won't do a great job and may even cause more damage to your car.

                            When you go to dispute the terrible service and the fact you were duped, she'll scream and freak and you'll give up because frankly
                            She's a pain to deal with and realize you're better off leaving your money behind.
